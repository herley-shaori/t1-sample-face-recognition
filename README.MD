 **# Face Recognition with SVM and Naive Bayes**

**This repository contains Python code for face detection, classification, and testing using OpenCV, SVM, and Naive Bayes.**

## Dataset

- The dataset used for training and testing is the LFW People dataset, available at: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/atulanandjha/lfwpeople](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/atulanandjha/lfwpeople)

## Usage

1. **Install required libraries:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. **Download the face cascade file:**
   - Download the `haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml` file from OpenCV's GitHub repository (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opencv/opencv/master/data/haarcascades/haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml) and place it in the project directory.
3. **Run the face recognition script (to be added):**
   ```bash
   python face_recognition.py
   ```

## Model Performance

- The performance of the machine learning models may vary depending on the dataset quality, model hyperparameters, and testing conditions.
- It's recommended to experiment with different hyperparameters and evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics.

## Disclaimer

- **Use this code with caution and at your own risk.**
- The author does not hold any responsibility for the results or consequences of using this code.
- It's essential to understand the limitations of the models and use them responsibly.

## Additional Notes

- This code is intended for educational and experimental purposes.
- For real-world applications, consider using more robust face recognition libraries and techniques.
